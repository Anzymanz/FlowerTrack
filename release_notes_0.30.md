## Highlights
- Stabilized the main tracker layout with a persistent draggable center splitter between stock and dose/usage panels.
- Reworked auth bootstrap into a reliable manual-first flow when credentials are missing, with clearer guidance and live account-tab logging.
- Hardened capture integrity to prevent partial pagination payloads from being parsed and corrupting history.
- Improved scraper startup UX with compact default sizing, hidden log-by-default behavior, and cleaner first-open window states.
- Continued UI consistency work across tracker/scraper windows, including theme sync, border/selection fixes, and reduced visual flicker.

## Changes
- Added a draggable center splitter between Flower Stock and Dose/Usage panels, with saved position across restarts.
- Fixed splitter persistence by validating and storing `main_split_ratio` in tracker config.
- Added debounced splitter save/apply behavior and stronger startup restore handling to reduce sash drift.
- Stabilized stock drawer toggling so panel widths remain consistent when opening/closing Add/Edit stock.
- Reduced scraper default height, hid scraper log panel by default, and enforced compact hidden-log sizing.
- Set clear scraper height targets by log visibility (compact hidden state vs expanded shown state).
- Improved auth bootstrap to avoid forced login-page refresh loops after successful sign-in.
- Added manual bootstrap mode for incomplete account setup (launch browser, wait for user login, capture auth).
- Added one-shot manual-login guidance popup when credential bootstrap requires user action.
- Stopped manual bootstrap from auto-refreshing/navigation loops while waiting for credentials.
- Added account-tab auth bootstrap logs so token acquisition progress is visible in real time.
- Improved fresh-start bootstrap routing to avoid duplicate bootstrap attempts in one cycle.
- Added API completeness guards so interrupted/incomplete pagination is discarded before parse/apply.
- Removed noisy 0.5s auth bootstrap progress flicker while waiting for auth headers.
- Synced tracker palette overrides into running scraper and flower library windows.
- Brought change history viewer visuals in line with active tracker theme and selection rules.
- Fixed lingering selection-highlight artifacts in settings/input controls.
- Improved settings/theme behavior for first-run dark-mode defaults and in-window theme updates.
- Added explicit swatch borders in colour settings for contrast in dark/light themes.
- Improved status indicator interactions (start/stop on double-click, mute/unmute on right-click, muted overlay state).
- Added Flower Browser irradiation filters (`β` and `γ`) for quicker filtering by beta/gamma treated products.
- Fixed stock deletion selection cleanup to avoid stale Treeview item exceptions.
- Fixed mixed-window and scraper geometry persistence paths that were falling back to stale defaults.
